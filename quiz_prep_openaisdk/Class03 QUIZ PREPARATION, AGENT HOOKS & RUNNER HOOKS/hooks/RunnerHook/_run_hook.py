######################### Pydantic example for validation #########################
# Pydantic is a data validation and settings management library for Python.
# It allows you to define data models with type annotations and perform validation automatically.
# Here, we define a Pydantic model MyTest that has three fields: id, idsub, and abc, all of which are integers.
# This is useful for ensuring that the data conforms to the expected types and structure,
# which can help prevent errors in your application.
