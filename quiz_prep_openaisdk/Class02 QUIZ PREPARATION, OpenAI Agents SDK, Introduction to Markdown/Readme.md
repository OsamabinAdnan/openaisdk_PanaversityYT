Heading level 2

# 👉 **Paragraphs**

To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.

I really like using Markdown.

I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.

# 👉 **Line Breaks**

To create a line break or new line (<br>), end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.

# 👉 **Emphasis**

You can add emphasis by making text bold or italic.

## **Bold**

* I just love **bold text**.
* I just love __bold text__.
* Love **is** bold

## **Italic**

To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase. To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters.

* Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.
* Italicized text is the _cat's meow_.
* A*cat*meow

## **Bold and Italic**

To emphasize text with **bold** and *italics* at the same time, add three asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold and italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add three asterisks without spaces around the letters.

* This text is ***really important***.
* This text is ___really important___.
* This text is __*really important*__.
* This text is **_really important_**.
* This is really***very***important text.

# 👉 **Blockquotes**

To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

## **Blockquotes with Multiple Paragraphs**

Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a > on the blank lines between the paragraphs.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

## **Nested Blockquotes**

Blockquotes can be nested. Add a >> in front of the paragraph you want to nest.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

## **Blockquotes with Other Elements**
Blockquotes can contain other Markdown formatted elements. Not all elements can be used — you’ll need to experiment to see which ones work.

> #### The quarterly results look great!
>
> - Revenue was off the chart.
> - Profits were higher than ever.
>
>  *Everything* is going according to **plan**.

## **Blockquotes Best Practices**

For compatibility, put blank lines before and after blockquotes.
