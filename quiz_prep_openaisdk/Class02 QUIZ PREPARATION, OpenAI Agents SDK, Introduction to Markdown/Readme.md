Heading level 2

# ğŸ‘‰ **Paragraphs**

To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.

I really like using Markdown.

I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.

# ğŸ‘‰ **Line Breaks**

To create a line break or new line (<br>), end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.

# ğŸ‘‰ **Emphasis**

You can add emphasis by making text bold or italic.

## **Bold**

* I just love **bold text**.
* I just love __bold text__.
* Love **is** bold

## **Italic**

To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase. To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters.

* Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.
* Italicized text is the _cat's meow_.
* A*cat*meow

## **Bold and Italic**

To emphasize text with **bold** and *italics* at the same time, add three asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold and italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add three asterisks without spaces around the letters.

* This text is ***really important***.
* This text is ___really important___.
* This text is __*really important*__.
* This text is **_really important_**.
* This is really***very***important text.

# ğŸ‘‰ **Blockquotes**

To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

## **Blockquotes with Multiple Paragraphs**

Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a > on the blank lines between the paragraphs.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

## **Nested Blockquotes**

Blockquotes can be nested. Add a >> in front of the paragraph you want to nest.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
>>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
>>>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

## **Blockquotes with Other Elements**
Blockquotes can contain other Markdown formatted elements. Not all elements can be used â€” youâ€™ll need to experiment to see which ones work.

> #### The quarterly results look great!
>
> - Revenue was off the chart.
> - Profits were higher than ever.
>
>  *Everything* is going according to **plan**.

## **Blockquotes Best Practices**

For compatibility, put blank lines before and after blockquotes.

# ğŸ‘‰ **Lists**

You can organize items into ordered and unordered lists.

## **Ordered Lists**

To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers donâ€™t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one.

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
    1. Indented item
    2. Indented item
    3. Indented item
        1. Sub-indented item
        2. Sub-indented item
4. Fourth item

## **Unordered Lists**

To create an unordered list, add dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items. Indent one or more items to create a nested list.

- First item
- Second item
* Third item
* Fourth item
+ Fifth item
+ Sixth item

---

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
    + Indented item
    + Indented item
        * Sub-indented item
        * Sub-indented item
            - Sub-indented item
            - Sub-indented item
- Fourth item

## **Starting Unordered List Items With Numbers**

If you need to start an unordered list item with a number followed by a period, you can use a backslash (\) to escape the period.

- 1968\. A great year!
- I think 1969 was second best.
