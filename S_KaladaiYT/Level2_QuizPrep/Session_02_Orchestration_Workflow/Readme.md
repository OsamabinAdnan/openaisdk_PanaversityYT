# **Agent Orchestration**

When people talk about agent orchestration, they usually mean how multiple tools, functions, or sub-agents are coordinated to solve a task. There are two main approaches:

## **1. Agent Orchestration via LLM (reasoning-driven orchestration)**

Here, the LLM itself decides which tools/agents to call, in what order, and when to stop.

* The orchestration logic is implicit, learned from the LLM’s training + instructions in the system prompt.

* **Example:**
    - You give the LLM access to tools (search_web, call_api, summarize)
    - You ask: “What’s the weather tomorrow in Karachi? Give me a short summary.”
    - The LLM decides:
        1) Call `search_web("Karachi weather tomorrow")`
        2) Parse the result
        3) Call `summarize(weather_text)`
        4) Return the answer

* **Pros:**

    - Very flexible, less code.
    - Easy to add new tools (just describe them).
    - LLM can chain tools in creative ways.

* **Cons:**

    - Less deterministic, harder to debug.
    - LLM might misuse tools (“hallucinated orchestration”).
    - Performance depends on prompt quality and model reasoning.

## **2. Agent Orchestration via Code (rule-driven orchestration)**

Here, Python handles orchestration logic explicitly, and the LLM is only called at specific steps.

* The orchestration logic is explicit in your program (like a workflow engine).

* **Example:**

```python
query = "What's the weather tomorrow in Karachi? Summarize it."

# Explicit orchestration in Python
weather_data = call_weather_api("Karachi")
summary = llm.generate(f"Summarize this weather report: {weather_data}")
print(summary)

```

* **Pros:**

    - Deterministic, easier to test/debug.
    - Predictable costs (you control calls).
    - Safer in production when reliability matters.

* **Cons:**

    - Less flexible (harder to generalize new tasks).
    - You (the developer) must design workflows.
    - Can’t leverage the LLM’s reasoning as much.
