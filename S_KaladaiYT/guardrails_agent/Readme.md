In the context of OpenAI's Agent SDK, a guardrail refers to mechanisms or constraints put in place to ensure that an AI agent behaves safely, predictably, and within defined boundaries while executing tasks autonomously. These are crucial in agentic AI, where agents can plan, act, and use tools dynamically.

## **Guardrail Concept in OpenAI Agent SDK:**
---
Guardrails define safety, ethical, and operational constraints that shape an agent’s behavior—ensuring alignment with human intent, policy compliance, and robust error handling during tool use and autonomous decision-making.

They help:

* Restrict tool access or input/output formats

* Validate or filter agent actions

* Enforce business or safety policies

* Prevent unintended or harmful behaviors
